# The greatest weapon in the history of mankind has been invented, and you already have it!

## Heralds of Change

Weapons are the physical manifestation of change. No matter how hard the conservative ideologies try to reclaim them, weapons are inherently against conservatism. Change is written into the artifact itself. 
When you pull the trigger, *nothing* is the same. Ever. For better or worse, weapons always strive for change. They don't preserve. That is exactly what they are designed for. Some may argue a weapon can be used to preserve to defend a life or deter an enemy. But this mistakes a consequence for the method. The act itself is never one of preservation. A life is preserved by ending another, a peace kept by the promise of total destruction. 
They have been used to both power a revolution and to end one. But never to maintain a state of being. Preservation is what a material strives for, not a tool. And in their many forms, weapons are the ultimate tool. They do not care for your opinion. They change, unapologetically.

## The Ultimate Weapon
Imagine a weapon more contagious than anything biology can come up with. What if it's also so indestructible that it often outlives its wielder. Its also faster than a speeding bullet and stronger than a nuclear weapon. Imagine something that kindled revolutions far more than the invention of gunpowder. 
You don't have to imagine, because this ultimate destructive force for change already exists, and it's not what you think.

## IDEAS!
Viva la revoluci√≥n, fellow reader! The ultimate weapon has been invented and you already have it! Somebody once told me sharing an idea is like throwing a stone into a lake. The ripples grow larger and larger at each moment. They told me, even us having this conversation is throwing a stone into the lake. If you keep throwing stones, one day the lake will be all but be covered by ripples. 

They are wrong and it's a shitty analogy. An idea is more like a fire. If it catches, it devastates. With each step it takes, it gets even more powerful. It finds more followers, more power and more destruction. It is alive. It eats, consumes and creates. Even though anyone can put out the fire on their cigarettes, the worlds 4th largest economy (the state of California if you can believe it) fails to put out the seasonal wildfires each year. The scale is everything and ideas are all about scale. The limit is your imagination, literally.

## Ideas are bulletproof

As V said, ideas ARE bulletproof. Any other conduit of change can be murdered or destroyed. Ideas are bulletproof. Unlike any physical weapon, they cannot be contained or disarmed. You can torment and enslave people, but the small corner in their heads will always belong to them... This unconquerable nature sets them apart from any other instrument of change. No matter how hard you're pushed, no matter how bad everything is, you will always have that centimeter square cube area in your mind all to yourself. No one in the history of mankind has had enough might to rule it let alone own it and no one ever will. You can force a man to say what you wish. You can never force anyone to believe it. Its unconquerable. It exists in a field of being all on its own.

## Heaven and Hell
"You know, my mother was an atheist. She used to say that there was good news and bad news about hell. The good news is hell is just the product of a morbid human imagination. The bad news is whatever humans can imagine, they can usually create." said Harmony Cobel from the series Severance. I, however, object! We also are capable of imagining heaven. And no matter how far away and perverted it is, we can bring it into existence in its entire glory. The capacity for imagining a better world is the ultimate manifestation of our imaginative weapon, poised to demolish the old and build the new. Just as the idea of hell has built its own prisons the idea of heaven will build its havens. It will devastate all that stay in its path and crumble to dust the empires that stood for millennia. 

## Dr. Strangelove or: How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
Do not fear destruction. Love the bomb! You cannot beat entropy but you can make the best of it. So shoot, and no I don't mean a gun. A gun could never hope to achieve what speaking your mind can. World is being ruled by people who've convinced everyone that they have a right to do so. Entire nations and organizations "exist" because people believe they exist. Power is imagined and it can always be re-imagined. Go change minds, shout your truth, bend the universe to your will. All it takes to destroy the lords in their slumber is the tender whisper of an idea.

## Bonus Song: Afraid by The Neighbourhood
If you're killed and then cloned with your exact memories, I don't think it's still you (my friends including Serhan contest me on this but assume I'm right for the sake of the aregument). I believe this implies consciousness requires continuity. Ideas are open to interpretation; I doubt it's intended, but this verse makes me think: if consciousness requires continuity, is it still really you when you wake up?

When I wake up, I'm afraid  
Somebody else might take my place
