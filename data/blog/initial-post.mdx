# initial post

## When is this Blog?

I started this blog today because currently my friend Tuna is currently staying with me and he showed me his [blog](https://tbozk.com). A day later I had some free time and asked the all powerful the creator of worlds ChatGPT to suggest me a Next.js template to quickly start.

## What is this Blog?
I will very infrequently write some stuff I currently think about here. The topics may range from how much I like the "temporal pincer movement" in Tenet and a specific line in a song I like.
I don't plan for anyone to read this blog ever putting aside the people I love that I'll force to read but happy surprises are welcome.
Also I named this post "initial post" like an "initial commit" in a Git repository. Do whatever you like with that information. I think this fact is a good start to know the kind of nerd I am (if you care that is).

## Why is this Blog?
I have many hot takes and small obscure stuff I obsess over. I also am not known for my incredible memory. So in a way this blog is a way to preserve my "priceless" hot takes and current obsessions.

## Bonus Song: These Boots Are Made for Walkinâ€™ by Nancy Sinatra
There is something about the line "One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you" in the chorus that rubs me the right way.

<div className="song-chorus">
These boots are made for walkin'  
And that's just what they'll do  
One of these days these boots are gonna         
Walk all over you
</div>
